ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Colleen!

My Focus

I primarily like to focus on front-end or full-stack development! My projects (pinned below) gave been reflections on my own interests and passions. With each, I maintain sleek modern, designs to maintain a sense of ease throughout the user experience despite the complexity of the apps themselves.

My Background 

I graduated from a 4-year univeristy with a B.S.B.A. focused on Marketing. I also have 2-year Master degree in Public Administration. I managed Guam's number one tourism market for the past 8 years as the leading Marketing Manager of Guam's tourism ministry. Desprite my interest i the subject matter, I did not feel fulfilled in my work.
